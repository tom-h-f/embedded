## Map

What is what?

- `bvr` - Code for the small ESP32C6 w/ LCD that jacob got me
- `mini-weather-1` - Code for a pico with a DHT11 and soil moisture sensor attached. All works fine just will require link up network wise.




## ESP

### Dev Tools

To set up the terminal environment:
```sh
cd ./esp
. ./export.sh # important that we source this, not execute it.
```
